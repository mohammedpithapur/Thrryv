# Thrryv – Reputation-Based Social Platform

Thrryv is a reputation-driven social platform where users are scored based on the **quality and usefulness** of their content — not virality. Every photo, video, or informative post is evaluated based on the **value it provides to the audience**.

Thrryv uses **agentic AI** (not just basic AI) to analyze posts, guide creators, and elevate meaningful contributions. Users offering high-value content gain more reach and visibility, while those with lower scores receive targeted suggestions to improve.

## 🚀 What Thrryv Does

Thrryv analyzes every post, comment, and interaction to determine:

* **Usefulness Score** – Is the content actually helpful?
* **Credibility Score** – Is the information trustworthy?
* **Engagement Quality** – Are interactions meaningful or spammy?
* **Profile Strength** – How consistent and positive is a user’s activity?

High-value content is boosted and shown to more users, while low-quality or spam content gets pushed down naturally.
